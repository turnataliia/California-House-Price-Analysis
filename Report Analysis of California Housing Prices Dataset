        Overview:
The analysis aimed to explore patterns and trends in the California Housing Prices Dataset.
The dataset contains information on various housing characteristics such as total rooms, total bedrooms, median income, and median house value across different regions in California.

        Key Findings:

Spatial Distribution of Housing Prices:
Coastal areas such as San Francisco and Los Angeles exhibit higher median house values compared to inland regions.
Inland areas show a more diverse range of housing prices, with some rural areas having lower median house values.

        Correlation between Features:
A strong positive correlation was observed between median income and median house value, indicating that areas with higher incomes tend to have higher housing prices.
A moderate positive correlation was found between total rooms and median house value, suggesting that larger homes command higher prices.

        Population Density and Housing Prices:
Areas with higher population density tend to have higher median house values, indicating higher demand for housing in densely populated regions.

        Demographic Factors:
There is a weak negative link between the median age and the median house value, indicating that lower property prices may be found in locations with younger populations.

        Insights:
The analysis reveals clear patterns of spatial variation in housing prices across California.
Housing costs are more likely to be higher in urban regions with higher incomes and population densities, underscoring the significance of location and demographic considerations.
These findings can help authorities and real estate investors make well-informed choices about investment strategies, urban planning, and housing development.
